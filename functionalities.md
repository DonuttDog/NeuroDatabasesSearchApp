After searching what you enter in the search bar, browse through the list of data to find which you wish to star. On the left upper side of each box of data, there is a Star icon. This icon represented by a classic star shape, and it is outlined if the item is not already starred. Click on the Star icon. This action results in the icon changing in appearance, turning a solid black to indicate that the data is now 'starred' as your favorite.
