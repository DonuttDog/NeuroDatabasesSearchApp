A simple Java application that combines multiple neuroscience databases into one search result!

### Features:
1. Advance Search:
    - You can use AND / OR to make precise searches
    - You can filter the search results by date range, data size, etc.

    - Or, you can display the results from each database independently
3. Download Data:
    - You can download data like models, experiment datasets, and neuron reconstructions from the search results
4. Save Search Results:
    - You can save search results locally (while not downloading the associated files)
    - When you open the application again, the saved search results will be reloaded
