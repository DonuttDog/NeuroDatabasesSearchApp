# NeuroDatabasesSearchApp

**NeuroDatabasesSearchApp** is a versatile search engine that retrieves data from multiple online databases, offering streamlined searches, personalized data storage, and easy query history management. With customizable display options and direct access to associated websites, it simplifies data exploration, combining five core functionalities for an intuitive user experience.

### Featured Databases:

1. [**Neuromorpho**](https://neuromorpho.org/): A repository for digital reconstructions and physiological data of neuronal morphologies from various animal species
2. [**Neuroelectro**](https://neuroelectro.org/): A database that gathers and organizes electrical characteristics of different types of neurons from published studies
3. [**ModelDB**](https://modeldb.science/): A database that offers a wide range of computational neuroscience models in different languages and simulation environments

## Authors & Acknowledgements

The Neuro-Database Search Engine is a collaborative effort from five University of Toronto students. 

Each person is responsible for finalizing the software design as well as coding 1-3 use cases and writing their tests. Besides, each took different roles:

**Markson Chen**: Proposed the project, drafted the overall architecture, coded all Swing UI, and led the team to finish this project. 

**Dennis Ding**: Handled all interactions to the online databases in making requests and processing fetched results.

**Jack Ma**: Wrote all query-related interactions from controllers to interactors.

**Robinson Lin**: Responsible for the coding aspect of the Star & History feature.

**Felix Peng**: Coded all use cases for switching from/to frames, panels, and websites
